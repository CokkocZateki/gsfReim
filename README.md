This repository is configured for working on Platform.sh. If you want to use it on your own hosting, you can either use the [Platform CLI](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli) to build the content locally, or simple point your web server to the `web` directory.

See the README.md in the `web` directory for more details on setup and configuration.
